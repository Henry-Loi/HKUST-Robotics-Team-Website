        <p class="text-muted">FPV drone racing, originating from the world of First Person View (FPV) flying, is an
            exhilarating sport that combines high-speed drone piloting and immersive video technology. Recognized by
            the FAI (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale), FPV drone racing competitions showcase skilled pilots
            navigating intricate courses with agility and precision, pushing the boundaries of aerial racing.
            Additionally, drone soccer, a captivating offshoot, introduces an exciting blend of robotics and
            sportsmanship as teams compete in dynamic matches, maneuvering drones to score goals and showcase their
            technical prowess.

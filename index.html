              <div class="question">Q1 Can I choose which competition I want to participate in?</div>
              <p class="answer">After going through training and being accepted into the team, you will be asked to
                state your preferences on which subteam you would like to join. Bear in mind however this does not 100%
                guarantee that you will get in to the subteam you want, but nearly everyone does.</p>

              <div class="question">Q2 Is the team very demanding in terms of skill level? Will I be kicked out of the
                team if I perform poorly?</div>
              <p class="answer">In our team, passion is more highly regarded than pure skill. As long as you are
                passionate and are willing to put in the time/effort to try, you are welcome here. We were all once
                confused and inexperienced. Senior members are also here to help!</p>

              <div class="question">Q3 Can I join the team if I am not a part of the Engineering School?</div>
              <p class="answer">We have no restrictions in terms of members' field of study. Anyone with any kind of
                background is welcome, and we have accepted Business/Science School students in the past. Our tutorials
                are designed for everyone, even those with zero relevant experience/knowledge, and we will teach you
                most of the things you need to know. Feel free to sign up if you are interested!</p>

              <div class="question">Q4 Is the selection process demanding for those with no experience?</div>
              <p class="answer">Again, we have tutorials that will teach you most of the things you need to know. We
                also don't accept members based on skill alone, and if you show that you are willing to put in effort,
                we will still accept you even if there are others with higher skill levels.</p>

              <div class="question">Q5 Will the interview be challenging?</div>
              <p class="answer">We will provide you with the interview questions beforehand, and you can choose the
                questions you wish to answer. The questions will not be very technical and are mostly open-ended. Feel
                free to look up anything online to help you! The interview is not meant to disqualify those with less of
                a robotics background, so please relax.</p>

              <div class="question">Q6 A lot of year 1 students have to go through major selection. Will joining greatly
                increase my workload and negatively impact my grades?</div>
              <p class="answer">While you definitely should not underestimate the workload from joining the team, past
                members didn't really see a significant impact to their grades. A portion of our year 1 members were
                still able to declare majors with a reputation for having a high GPA requirement. (cough computer
                science cough) You will also find that a portion of teammates may be taking the same courses as you, and
                having study partners always helps! If you are still unsure, consider joining the tutorials and/or the
                Robot Design Contest to get a feel for things. We won't pressure anyone to stay, so if you find that the
                workload really is too demanding, you can quit at any part of the recruitment process. You can also ask
                seniors for help regarding courses as they may have taken them before!</p>

              Our role in the mechanical department of the robotics team is at the forefront of the entire team's
              operations. Our decisions directly impact the fundamental capabilities of our final product. Our primary
              responsibility is to design and build acompetition robot that can participate in our competitions. To
              meet the challenges of these competitions, we approach robotics design with innovation and creativity.
              <br> <br>
              Our journey begins with the inception of an idea, where we apply our accumulated knowledge to create a
              blueprint that defines the form and function of the robot. We delve into the intricacies of mechanical
              design, focusing on aspects such as structural integrity, weight distribution, and efficiency. With our
              familiarity with various manufacturing techniques, we can bring these designs to life using methods like
              3D printing or CNC machining.
              <br> <br>
              Our toolkit goes beyond mere blueprints and materials. We masterfully employ a wide array of power tools,
              from digital milling machines to handheld power drills. Actuators, the vital components of our creation,
              are carefully selected and integrated to transform our machine into a responsive and agile marvel. As
              members of the mechanical department, we are both artisans, engineers, and problem solvers, diligently
              working to craft robots that deliver the strongest performance.

              programming concepts and have experience working with hardware systems.
              <br> <br>
              We primarily write code in languages such as C, utilizing tools like CubeIDE and debuggers to
              troubleshoot
              issues and optimize performance. Additionally, we engage in circuit design, component selection, and
              the

              <br> <br>
              Our strengths lie in our ability to skillfully write code using various languages in
              specialized IDEs. We also utilize tools like Git and CMake to support us in large-scale projects.
              Moreover,
              we leverage open-source libraries and packages across various operating systems to assist us in
              implementing
              advanced features like computer vision.
              <br> <br>
              Ultimately, our main objective is to unleash the true potential of our robots' mechanical and
              hardware
              components. Simultaneously, we act as the bridge between the robot and the driver by creating a
              simple
              and
              effective interface that is easy to control. Joining the HKUST Robotics Software Team would not only
              allow
              you to familiarize yourself with various programming languages and applications but also provide you
              with
              valuable experience in collaborative settings.
